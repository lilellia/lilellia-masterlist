            <p>Hi, I'm <span class="lilellia">lilellia</span>, the butterfly princess of hugs! Welcome to my masterlist!</p>
            <p>I mostly write cute, domestic/fluff, a bit of romance (established or friends-to-lovers), usually F4F/F4A</p>

        <h2>Terms of Script Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li class="terms-of-use"><b>Usage:</b> All of my scripts are freely available for use. Please credit me (<a href="https://reddit.com/user/lilellia">u/lilellia</a> and/or @lilellia) if you use the script, and let me know—I'd love to see what you come up with! Feel free to monetise it (but DM me first if you want to post on Patreon, etc.).</li>
            <li class="terms-of-use"><b>Editing:</b> Small changes to the scripts are okay, but please ask before making any major line changes, additions, deletions, gender swaps, etc. Vocal cues and sound effects are suggestions, so feel free to be creative with those!</li>
            <li class="terms-of-use"><b>Other notes:</b> I find it easier to write the listener's dialogue rather than keep track of half of a conversation, so their lines are given for context but aren't meant to be voiced. The word counts given only include the spoken text.</li>
        </ul>
